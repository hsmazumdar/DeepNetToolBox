# DeepNetToolBox
Multi-Layer Neural Net Optimization with Pruning
The 'Deep Net Tool Box' is a research and learning aid developed in dotNet, C#, featuring an interactive GUI. It is an open-source repository hosted on GitHub. This tool utilizes a novel multi-layer neural network model with an implementation of back-propagation learning. One of its key highlights is the network optimization capability through the 'Prune' command. By using pruning, the tool optimizes connections and neurons that are essential for the specific dataset, leading to a more efficient network configuration.
Another notable feature of the 'Deep Net Tool Box' is the ability to choose different Neuron Activation functions. This, combined with the pruning functionality, allows the tool to automatically minimize the network configuration based on the specific Input-output relationship, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient network design.
Moreover, the tool provides the option to export the network configuration as a text file, which can be easily edited according to research requirements, and then imported back into the system. This allows researchers to experiment with different configurations and fine-tune the neural network for their specific needs.
The data files used by the tool are in a simple CSV format with appropriate headers. These files are automatically generated by the system, but users also have the flexibility to import data from other sources for their experiments and analyses.
Overall, the 'Deep Net Tool Box' offers a comprehensive set of features, making it a valuable resource for researchers and learners working with neural networks in the dotNet and C# environment.
